This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant through the application of machine learning algorithms. I conducted a thorough evaluation of several models, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and embedding models. Following extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, the logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy,  when using its default parameters.
