This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant using machine learning algorithms. I evaluated various models, including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and embedding models. After extensive experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, I achieved a high accuracy rate with the logistic regression model.
